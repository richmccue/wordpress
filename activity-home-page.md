# Website Planning & Home Page Considerations

1. Before you set up your website, let’s make sure that you’re prepared... Begin with the end in mind:
  - Have you looked at other portfolio websites on the internet for inspiration?  If not, take 5 minutes and google “portfolio websites”, and make notes about things you would like to include in your website (e.g. layout, look & feel menus, and pages or features.)
  - Do you have ideas for a name for your website? _________________________________
  - Do you have a list of pages and/or sections for your website? Eg: Resume, portfolio, blog...
  - Do you have a top-level navigation structure in mind for your website (usually at the top of every web page? Eg: Home, Portfolio, About, Blog, Contact)
  - Did you create a pen and paper outline of what you want your website to look like?  If you did, this will be a great guide as you look at different Wordpress template options.
