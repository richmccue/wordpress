# Account Setup with OpenEd.ca
**This activity is for UVic Students, Faculty, and Staff** who would like to create a non-commercial WordPress Website (note: a portfolio website that is used for a job serarch is considered non-commercial). If you are not part of the UVic community or would like to create a commercial website of some kind, please start with the [WordPress.com account setup activity](account-setup-post.html).

OpenEd.ca websites hosted by a team of B.C. post-secondary education IT professionals on BCNet’s EduCloud, so your data is stored within B.C.  Because it is a University hosted website it cannot be used for commercial purposes. That said, in addition to school projects, you could also use your website as a personal portfolio to help you in your future job searches.

The website account creation process can take some time to process after you’ve requested an account, so that is why we are asking you to start your account creation process before class time.

**1. Create an Account at OpenEd.ca**
  - Go to [opened.ca](https://opened.ca/){:target="_blank"} 
  ![OpenEd homepage](/images/opened-setup-01.png)
  - Click the red ‘**Get started**’.
  ![Get Started button](/images/opened-setup-02.png)
  - **Complete the form**.
    - Remember, if you want to be anonymous, you can use a pseudonym for your username.
    - **You MUST use your own UVic email address (NOT Gmail or other email address - use your …@uvic.ca email address. Do not use YourNameHere)**.
    - Make sure you choose ‘**Give me a site!**’
    - Click ‘**Next**’<br>

**2. Choose a Web Address, Website Name, and Template**  
  - Create a URL domain for your site, which will be ______.opened.ca, where you fill in the blank (for example, if you entered **hmccue** here, then your website address would be **hmccue.opened.ca**).
    - The URL can contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers, and hyphens (no spaces allowed)
    - If you want to remain anonymous, don’t include your name here.
    - You cannot easily change this later.
  - Give your site a title, which you can change later (for example you could use **Portfolio Website** as the site title, or **Course Work**, or any other title you’d like).
  - Choose your privacy setting
    - The top Yes/No option (allow search engines) are open on the web – we encourage one of these two options.
  - Select the **EPORTFOLIO TEMPLATE 2** template, then click the black **Signup** button at the bottom of the page (you can easily select a different template later).<br>

**3. Go make some tea, and check your email in about 3-5 minutes.**
        - Sometimes the confirmation email takes a few minutes, if you don’t see it in 10-15 minutes, check your spam/junk folder.
        - You can check your UVic email at the following address: [https://webmail.uvic.ca](https://webmail.uvic.ca){:target="_blank"} 
   ![Confirmation email example](/images/opened-setup-05.png)
  - **Activate your username**.
        - The email will come from ‘OpenETC Administrator’ and will contain a link that you must follow to activate your account.<br>
   ![Second confirmation email example with link](/images/opened-setup-06.png)
        - Activation email.
  - Then you’ll get another email.
        - Click **Log in**
        - Confirmation email.<br>

3. Go back to the Get Started link in Step 2. The form you filled our to create a username will turn into a form to create a site. It says to "add another site" even though you haven't added one before. Fill out the form. If you are met with another page asking you to give your site an address, the last option should be the first domain you chose with the option to “Skip Purchase”. And another page to Start with a free site.
