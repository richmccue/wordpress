# Account Setup with OpenEd.ca
In this exercise, you will create your own Wordpress website using OpenEd.com that would be suitable for a personal portfolio. If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this, please ask your instructor for assistance. Have fun!

1. Before you set up your website, let’s make sure that you’re prepared... Begin with the end in mind:
  - Have you looked at other portfolio websites on the internet for inspiration?  If not, take 5 minutes and google “portfolio websites”, and make notes about things you would like to include in your website (e.g. layout, look & feel menus, and pages or features.)
  - Do you have ideas for a name for your website? _________________________________
  - Do you have a list of pages and/or sections for your website? Eg: Resume, portfolio, blog...
  - Do you have a top-level navigation structure in mind for your website (usually at the top of every web page? Eg: Home, Portfolio, About, Blog, Contact)
  - Did you create a pen and paper outline of what you want your website to look like?  If you did, this will be a great guide as you look at different Wordpress template options.

2. Create an Account at OpenEd.ca
  - Go to [opened.ca](https://opened.ca/){:target="_blank"}
